# GraphCMS ⨯ NextAuth.js

[Join our Slack](https://slack.graphcms.com)

This example demonstrates how to query from GraphCMS [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org).

Users can login or register using the same form (for the purposes of this demo), and update their profile name/bio.

NextAuth.js has a [REST API](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api) you should use to create custom login pages.

## How to Use

You will need to create a Permanent Auth Token to use this example locally.

Inside of `.env` add the following:

```dosini
GRAPHCMS_ENDPOINT=
GRAPHCMS_TOKEN=
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=somethingsupersecret
```

You will need to set `NEXTAUTH_URL` as your actual URL if deploying.

You will also need to follow instructions [here](https://github.com/graphcms/graphcms-examples#using-this-repo) to configure the models this project needs to work.
